**Address generates real addresses from official registers and map data.** China uses residential-community addresses; other countries also support real street-level addresses, preserving source house numbers when available. Missing premises are never invented. Source coordinates link each address to Google Maps or AMap.

## Highlights

- 27 configured countries and regions with country, administrative-area, city, district, and postcode filters where supported.
- Strict filter semantics: an empty matching pool returns an error instead of silently switching to another location.
- Fast database-backed random selection across the complete eligible scope; it does not repeatedly read the first rows.
- Source/native, English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Spanish, and Portuguese presentation paths.
- Address and profile language choices persist independently in the browser; first use defaults to English.
- Browser-persistent address favorites with continent/country grouping, filters, drag-and-drop or numeric ordering, copy, delete, and Google Maps/AMap links.
- Popular administrative areas, popular cities, and special areas are configurable per country. The United States includes states without statewide sales tax.
- Public coverage monitor plus administrator dashboard, address-data rules, synchronization queue and history, quick-location editor, provider credentials, access control, blacklist, and API tokens.
- JSON API for health, readiness, countries, availability, location options, search, address/profile generation, batch generation, and monitoring, with Python, cURL, and JavaScript examples.
- PostgreSQL-only runtime with pooled connections, transactional publication, indexed location search, and prebuilt random-address indexes.

## Address sources and fields

The table lists fields and residential evidence supplied by existing sources. Outside China, real street-level records do not require house numbers or residential evidence. Their missing premises stay empty; postcodes are retained only when verified and unambiguous. All records require valid source, geography and language. Residential evidence applies only to the residential subset.

## Automated synchronization

A country is complete only when every enabled rule passes:

1. total eligible-record target;
2. lowest administrative-level coverage and per-node minimums;
3. level-1 and level-2 minimums where configured;
4. every explicit node override.

Reaching only the total target does not mark a country complete. Conversely, a source proven to be exhausted is kept visible as incomplete but removed from active work until its source/version fingerprint changes.

The queue applies bounded retries, exponential backoff, cooldown/quota reset times, resumable checkpoints, no-progress latching, and suspension after repeated failures. It cannot run the same unchanged no-progress source indefinitely. Run history records each source, duration, result, and address growth, while stale synchronization artifacts are cleaned automatically. China receives the highest automatic priority while it remains eligible.

## Deployment

```bash
mkdir address && cd address
curl -fsSLo docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daimon3332/address/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The initial administrator password is `admin`; the frontend password is disabled. Change either initial value in `docker-compose.yml` before the first start. The administrator console requires the default administrator password to be replaced after sign-in.

See the [deployment guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete instructions.

## Configuration and API keys

- Frontend and administrator passwords, API tokens, provider credentials, quotas, and quick locations are managed in the administrator console.
- Provider keys are optional unless the selected synchronization strategy needs them.
- Multiple credentials rotate independently. A failing key is cooled down while another available key is tried; when all keys are unavailable, work waits for the earliest reset.
- Follow the dedicated [API key configuration guide](docs/API_KEYS.md) for provider purposes, official application links, and administrator entry names.
